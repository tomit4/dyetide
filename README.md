# dyetide - a simple bash color converter

__dyetide is a simple tool for converting your hex code to rgba codes... or visa
versa! dyetide uses classic command line tools like grep, sed, awk, cut, and bc
to parse through a file (usually css) and convert all hex code to rgba or
rgba to hex code. Included is a standalone tool called dye, which is a separate
command line tool for doing one at a time color conversions, for when you need
to know what a hex/rgba/hsla code is in another color code right now!__
